# Motivation
I'm really interested in learning new technologies, take new challenges and improve my skills in general. This seems to be the perfect opportunity to do it so.
A modern Fintech like Pontte could be the connecting point to these knowledges.

This challenge was fun to develop but at the same time it took time and effort to complete.
The perfect balance between testing skills and creating content.
